# ProtectMe-LoadLibrary

ProtectMe-LoadLibrary is a simple project is intended to make you receive notifications about the status of modules that are loaded and unloaded in real time in your application, avoiding unnecessary hooks.

This is useful for a variety of purposes, such as protecting your application against dlls that can load malicious code.

In addition to removing the dependency on user-mode hooks, its efficiency is as good as kernel-mode notification contexts.
